							<td width="50%"><h3><center>About Taj Mahal</center></h3><p>The Taj Mahal which is widely considered as the most beautiful building in the world is located in the historical city of <b>Agra</b>, called as the "symbol of love". It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan said about the Taj that it made "the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes". The Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of palaces in the Persian language. It is a breath stealing moment when the gates of this monument are traversed, and the Taj Mahal comes into the focus. It is consider as the finest example of Mughal architecture and is now a UNESCO world heritage site. Covering a land over 60 bighas, the Taj Mahal was constructed using only white marbles obtained from Makrana in Rajasthan.</p><p>It took almost 17 years to complete the construction of the Taj Mahal, and it was finally completed by 1653. The tomb is laid out in a rectangular shape, and that can be approached through a massive gateway which has an arch and alcoves on either side of it. The Taj Mahal is so, majestic from the exterior, has equally splendid artistic work done in the interiors. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance which makes the monuments even more spectacular. Simply said that it was the most beautiful building in the world, and it is impossible to saw it without feeling wonderstruck!</p><center><img src="../images/tajmahal_4.jpg"></center><p>There is a well-publicized theory that Taj Mahal was a Shiva Temple built in the 12th century which was later converted into the memorial for Mumtaz Mahal. This theory was developed by Purushottam Nagesh Oak. He filled a petition to have the sealed basement rooms open to prove his theory, but it was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2000.</p><p>Another story is famous as The Black Taj Mahal. Many people beleived that Shah Jahan planned to built an alter image of the monument in black marble on its opposite side, the work for which began before he was imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb. Extensive excavations were carried out at Mehtab Bagh, but no traces were found of any such construction.</p><p>The famous legend related to the Taj Mahal is the multilation of the craftsmen who constructed it. It is believed that on the completion of the construction, Shah Jahan ordered the hands of the project's craftsmen to be chopped off so that no other building in the world could be this beautiful again. However, there is no historical evidence to support this theory.</p></td>
