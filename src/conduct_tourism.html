UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001, which had increased to about 7-8 million in 2014. A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. In 2018, the fee for indian citizens was 50 INR, for foreign tourists 1100 INR. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking lots or catch an electric bus. The khawasspuras are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.</p><p>The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.</p><img src="../images/tajmahal_5.jpg" width="100%"><p>The grounds are open from 6:00 to 19:00 weekdays, except for Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 to 14:00. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after, excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan. For security reasons only five items-water in transparent bottles, small video cameras, still cameras, mobile phones and small ladies` purses- are allowed inside the Taj Mahal.</p></td>
