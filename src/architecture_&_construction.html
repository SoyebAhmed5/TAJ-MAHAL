							<td width="50%"><h3><center>Architecture & Construction</center></h3><p>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from seccessful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the <b><i>Gur-e Amir</i></b>(the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb, Itmad-ud-Daulad's Tomb(also known as Baby Taj) and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.</p><p><h4><b><i><u>Tomb</u></i></b></h4></p><p>The Tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of Tha Taj Mahal. It is a large white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consist of a symmetrical building with an iwan(an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.</p><p>The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 meters(180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building.</p><p><h4><b><i><u>Exterior Decorations</u></i></b></h4></p><p>Abstact forms are used throughout especially in the plinth, minaretes, gateway, mosque, jawab and to a lesser extent on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.</p><p>On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The inlays stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.</p><img src="../images/tajmahal_8.jpg" width="100%"><p><h4><b><i><u>Garden</u></i></b></h4></p><p>The complex is set around a large 300-meter(980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden. The garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the center of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north-south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The raised marble water tank is called 'AL-Hawd AL-Kawthar' in reference to the "Tank of Abundance" promised to Muhammad.</p><p>The garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah(Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning 'Walled Garden'. Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the center. Tha Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden.</p></td>
